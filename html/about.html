        <h4><strong>What is Sailboat?</strong></h4>
        <p><small>Current web browsers have failed in some key areas of web browsing such as tab clutter, tab management, lack of support for preserving user privacy, limited value in browser history and lack of ease of use in using bookmarks etc. While tabs make browsing much convenient they also add to visual clutter and distract users away from the task at hand. All the user's interactions with the browsers are recorded only on the server side. The data generated by the user is not stored on the client side and is unavailable for their own use, across websites.

            We have developed a Chrome extension that attempts to solve these problems. Sailboat, our Chrome extension, provides Task based browsing environment to reduce tab clutter, compartmentalisation of history, bookmarks and liked pages, automatic clustering of pages in history to help users identify tasks in their browsing etc. These features provide foundation for many more novel features that we would like to develop in the future.</small></p>
